# Teachable Super Admin [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-javascript.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Additional features for the Teachable Admin

This is a script file for Tampermonkey, a chrome plugin which allows JavaScript files to be 'injected' into websites.

This is perfectly safe but I am offering this as an open source project so people can see that there is no malicious code in this project.

What this script does is to give the Admin a bit more control over exporting sections.

Right now, only the Code Snippets sections and pages work. This includes:

* CSS
* Header Code
* Logged In
* Logged Out
* HTML/Liquid Blocks

The platform is throwing up some interesting conundrums that will need to be ironed out before allowing this to be used outside of our test school.

Currently working on the lectures view along with User Experience and UI design.
